### Genotype Imputation with 'loimpute'
### MGAP data for reference panel (Bimber et al., 2019)

## Info on filtering and phasing MGAP files is in /scratch/nsnyderm/mgap. Once MGAP reference files are filtered and phased, use as reference for imputation of Cayo WGS files. 

## Work in: /scratch/mwatowic/gxe_project/gxe_modeling/cayo_vcfs_impute/

# 1) Need the following files: 
# chroms                is a list of all chromosomes
# loimpute_latest.sif   is the loimpute environment
# samples               is a list of samples/files that will be imputed.


# 2) Need the following empty directories: 
# pileups/
# imputed/
# merged_imputed/


# 3) Mkdir mgap/ and copy the filtered and phased MGAP files per chromosome to it. 
# cp /scratch/nsnyderm/mgap/mgap.chr*.phased.AFfilt.vcf.gz mgap/


# 4) Perform pileup of WGS bams: pileup.sh
# WGS bams: /data/CEM/smacklab/data/mapped_reads/cayo_WGS/*.mmul10.bam.bam
# Use the new mgap filtered & phased files as the reference (/scratch/nsnyderm/mgap/mgap.chr*.phased.AFfilt.vcf.gz)


# 5) Impute with loimpute: impute_single_chrom.sh
# Imputed one chromosome at a time 
# Set effective pop = 10,000
# Reference files = phased MGAP files that were filtered for AF > 1% & <99% post-phasing. 
# Make sure to also make tabix indexed files 

# New imputed data will be: /scratch/mwatowic/gxe_project/gxe_modeling/cayo_vcfs_impute/

# 6) Merge imputed results by chromosome with bcftools: merge_imputed.sh

# 7) Filter imputed results for genotype probability > 0.9 , MAF > 0.05, and HWE threshold 10e-8: filterGP.sh filterHW_MAF.sh
